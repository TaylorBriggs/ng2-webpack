### Angular 2 + Webpack
A starter project and small example of how to write Components and Services in ES6.

### Getting started
1. ```git clone https://github.com/nigelgilbert/ng2-webpack.git```
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm run watch```
4. Check out localhost:8080 to edit your Angular 2 app on webpack's dev server.

### About
Uses Webpack and Babel to transpile the "@" decorators to ES2015 javascript.  Also makes use of [Webpack's dev server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) feature to live reload changes.
